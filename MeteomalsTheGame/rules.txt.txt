Setup:
Players can have as many Meteomal and Reaction Cards on them as possible
Players must have the following dice: d4, d6, d8
Recommended Components: d10 and tokens

Players can only have one Meteomal and one Reaction card down at a time

Game Goal:
Reach Level 10 then defeat an opponent's Meteomal

Weakness Chart:
sun > snow
snow > cloud
cloud > sun

Card Types:
Meteomal Card - creature card that features element type on top left corner and stats on bottom right corner
Reaction Card - specific action cards that can be activated in the right situations

First Turn:
Players place face down one Meteomal and can place face down one Reaction Card

Turn Steps (Performed Every Turn):
Both players roll a d6
The player with the higher number attacks first
If the same number is rolled then roll until one player gets a higher roll

Players may place face down a Reaction card if they do not have any down
Any face down Meteomal Cards are revealed
If a player has no Meteomal on the field they can place one face up
(Players are allowed to use the same Meteomals over and over again if they choose)

Attacking player rolls to attack based on Weakness typing
If Stronger roll a d8
If Weaker roll a d4
If Same roll a d6

Defending player rolls a d6 to Evade
If a 6 is rolled the attack is evaded

The attacking player adds the roll plus the Meteomal attack together
Then the attacking player subtracts the defending Meteomal's defense from the sum
That number is removed from the Meteomal's remaining health
Attack damage cannot be reduced below 0

If a Meteomal's health drops to 0 or less it is defeated and removed from the field
The turn ends when a Meteomal is defeated

If the player that went first this turn does not defeat the defending Meteomal then the defending player takes their turn attacking

During turns if the situation is right a Reaction card can be activated
ex. Player misses an Evade roll and has a card to allow a re-roll they can play it

Once both players have taken their chance to attack the turn resets
Players continue this flow until one player wins
